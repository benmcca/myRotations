# [myRotations](https://my-rotations.vercel.app/)
myRotations is a full-stack application developed with the **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack**. The project is still a work in progress, and I am going to work on it more this summer. It leverages the iTunes API to retrieve data on my most listened-to albums and presents them in an immersive gallery format.

## Key Features

- Utilizes the iTunes API to fetch and display my most listened-to albums.
- Presents album covers and information in a visually appealing "coverflow" format.
- Implements a search bar for filtering results by album, artist, or song name.
- Ability to filter results by genre
- Provides a feature for randomizing the selection of albums in the gallery.
- Enables users to view album details, listen to song previews, and leave comments.
- Implements user authentication for commenting functionality.
- Allows users to edit or delete their comments.
